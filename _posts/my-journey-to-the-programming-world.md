Hi, I'm Tepy, from Cambodia ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡­.
I came to Japan in 2015 to pursue my undergraduate study in
Computer Science with a full scholarship.

## After High School

Back in Cambodia in 2012, I was majored in Civil Engineering since I didn't know what I really wanted to do back then. After
studying for almost 2 years, I found myself having more interest
in programming than civil engineering.

I started my first line of code in **Lua** while trying
to make mobile game with my friends. I started out as I was
really curious about how people make games or applications by
that time, but eventually I got hooked into the world of
programming without knowing it myself.

## Coming to Japan

Fast forward to 2015, I decided to change my major to Computer
Science as I started my new chapter in Japan as a college
student here. During my 1st year in Japan, I needed to take
Japanese class over the course of 1 year, so during that time I
could only learn programming during my spare time only.

As I started out as a self-taught programmer, it really took me
quite a long time to finally understand the **Foundation of Programming**. I could recall being
confused between **i++** and **++i** for quite
some time.

## Into the real-world development

After I finally have conquered the foundation in **C**,
I started building **Android Applications** with **Udacity's Nanodegree Online Course**.
