Hi, I'm Tepy, a Frontend Developer from Cambodia ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡­ who is currently studying Computer Science in Japan.

I decided to become a Frontend Developer about 2 years ago after I started learning about the WEB, especially _React.js_.
The reason I chose to become a Frontend Developer despite having interest in being a Fullstack Developer as well
is that I enjoy seeing the result of my works **immediately** and I am quite interested in beautiful **UI/UX** as well.

Before entering the WEB territory, I think I have had quite a long story about how I even got myself into the programming world, which I would like to write about in the following context.

## High School

> Mathematics Lover

During my 3 years in high school, I had a _dream goal_ of getting into **The Top 10** rank in the _National Mathematics Olympiad_ in 2012.

I spent all my free time studying Math just for that competition. Thanks to the lack of internet availabilty at my hometown (I live in a rural area), I was able to put all my concentration in studying Math.

As the result of endlessly solving many Math problems everyday for 3 years, I was able to achieve my dream goal where I placed **1st** in the _National Mathematics Olympiad_. It would be a lie if I told you it was not my greatest achievment in my life :D

## After High School

> Clueless about future goal

Even tho I achieved my dream goal, I barely knew anything related to what I want to become in the future. Due to the lack of information, I chose to study Civil Engineering as it is quite a common major for a student who is good at Math to choose back then in Cambodia.

In the 1st year in college, there was a compulsary course about general knowledge of computer and internet that introduced me to know more about computer in general. After that course, I only gained the general knowledge of computer, nothing more nothing less.

## My first line of code

After hanging out with a few Computer Science friends of mine, I started my first line of code in `Lua` while trying to make mobile game with them. I started out as I was really curious about how people make games and applications by that time, but eventually I got hooked into the world of programming without knowing it myself.

Later on, I kept finding myself spending more and more time learning different things related to programming. Starting from taking `Python` class as one of my elective courses to publishing my first ever mobile game. It was a clone of Flappy Bird game since that game was super popular at that time. However, what I did was creating my own assets and wrote some really lame logic for the flying logic (I knew nothing about `physics logic for game`) for the bird :D and I could not understand at all when it comes to much difficult code.

## Coming to Japan

> New journey begins

Fast forward to 2015, I decided to change my major to Computer Science as I started my new chapter in Japan as a college student here. During my 1st year in Japan, I needed to take Japanese class over the course of 1 year, so during that time I could only learn programming during my spare time.

As I started out as a self-taught programmer, it really took me quite a long time to finally understand the **Foundation of Programming**. I could recall being confused between **i++** and **++i** for quite some time. Also, as a beginner I could not understand well how `while` and `for` loops really work at all.

## Into the real-world development

> What keeps me going

After I finally have solidated the foundation in **C**, I started building **Android Applications** with **Udacity's Nanodegree Online Course**. Since I like seeing the result of my work immediately, building applications really encourages me to learn to code much better than just learning the basics.

While building mobile application, I have learned to understand how an application is built with seperated pieces. It is composed of the **UI**(frontend) and the **Data** and many other parts together. As an application engineer, I spent most of the time implementing the UI look of the application and fetched the data from various apis to fill in the application.

That's also when I've first learned about **API**. At first, I was not sure how the api really works at all. All I knew was that I could retrieve data from it and use it in my application. After a while, I got used to calling the api to get some data with some libraries and use it in the app. Then eventually I got to touch the **database** of the app when I tried to store data that I got from the api for offline usage. Writing database's query was something new to me as I was always dealing with just the UI of the app. So I found it somehow confusing most of the time.

I also first learned a bit about the application archeticture such as MVVP, MVP etc.

## From Native Mobile to the Web

> Expanding knowledge

While I learned a lot building native application, I felt something is lacked with my current knowledge.

## React.js

> Where it all started again

## Internships

> Gold opportunities

## Current

> Finding my first fulltime job

## Ending thought

> Keep on learning
